These are audio files containing hexaphonic guitar music. They consist of short musical excerpts (guitar riffs and phrases) for which the
sound of each string is separated into an independent audio signal. The file names follow the next structure:

(GuitarPhraseName)_(StringNumber).wav

The files with the label "MIX" in the StringNumber contain the Mix signal of all the strings, and these help to make an idea of the 
musical content of the file. The audio file corresponding to each string should be aligned (syncronized) with the others. Thereby, 
playing the 6 audio files of a particular guitar phrase simutaneously sounds as the MIX file.

Note.: some guitar phrases do not have the 6 audios (6 strings), as some of them were not used and thus silent audio signals. These were 
already deleted.
